# Reddit to Lemmy Crosspost Bot
Some of the post popular content on reddit is crossposts from bots that follow Twitter, Facebook, TikTok etc.  This is a way to build some foundation for new communities to grow on.

Please be sure using a bot to post content isn't against your community or instance rules before you unleash it.  The default waits 10 seconds, otherwise it posts pretty quickly and is likely to get banned pretty quickly.
